# Wonderful Poem

Once upon a time in York Tech 
A school that didn't fit in with the rest
The teacher walked in, quite a wreck
I saw a bunch of strange kids walking around
Where it was an absolute wreck
There was a Zergling
There was an ogre and his name was Shrek
There was a leaf who hated rabbits
There was a boy named luke and he had a drinking problem with gatorade
There was a man named Luke who wanted to be king
